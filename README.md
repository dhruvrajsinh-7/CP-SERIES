## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
This repo contains several most important topic of dsa <br>
<b>1).Array <br>
2).Backtracking <br>
3).Binarysearch <br>
4).Daily-challnges <br>
5).Dynamic-programming <br>
6).Hash-map<br>
7).Linkedlist <br>
8).Sliding window <br>

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
->You have to first choose one particular language for solving problems on leetcode ,gfg ,codeforces or codechef <br>
->you can prefer c++ or java (most recommended) 
->The daily challenge folder contains almost all type of questiones like
1).based on recursion ->dfs/bfs
2).based on strings ->lcs,lis, 
3).based on queue or stack using array or vector/list
4).based on tree traversal or certain operation on tree
6).based on hard dp questions
### Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>

So first of all this are the basic fundamental you should have for solving problems on dsa/standard dsa
```
You should have syntax knowledge regarding any language you use
Basic terminology
Understanding of memory allocation
Should have idea about how loop works how all airthmetic,relational,mathematical operation works 
Should have proper knowledge of constrains used in particular questions
```
## 🚀 Learning tuts <a name = "learning"></a>
->You can start by learning fundamentals of language with ==> codewithharry,jenny's lecture on youtube (recommended) <br>
->After that you can learn how the standard algorithm works ==> abdul bari , aditya verma on youtube (recommended)<br>
->If you want to start with problem solving and you have enough knowledge of whatever language you have choosen then ==> striver,nick white , aditya verma , peepcoding on youtube (most recommended) <br>
->you can also refer articals ,website based on dsa just like gfg <br>
